<p>Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past</p>

<p>When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way</p>

<p>Very superstitious, wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem, do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong
You don't want to save me, sad is my song</p>

<p>When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh</p>

<p>Very superstitious, nothin' more to say
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past.</p>

<p>When you believe in things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, no, no, no</p>
